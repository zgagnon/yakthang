# Docker Mode

## Overview

The Yak Orchestrator supports two runtime modes:
- **Zellij mode**: Workers run directly in Zellij tabs as native processes
- **Docker mode**: Workers run inside Docker containers, launched in Zellij tabs

Both modes present the same UX — the worker gets a Zellij tab with the
opencode TUI in the top pane and a shell in the bottom pane. Docker mode
adds container isolation around the opencode process.

## Prerequisites

- Docker Engine installed, user in docker group
- Zellij running (Docker workers still use Zellij tabs for the TUI)
- Worker image built: `docker build -f worker.Dockerfile -t yak-worker:latest .`
- `OPENCODE_API_KEY` exported in your environment (e.g. `~/.profile`)

## How Docker Mode Works

Docker mode is **not** headless. The flow is:

1. `yak-box spawn` writes the prompt to a temp file
2. It generates a wrapper script that runs `docker run -it` with the prompt
3. It creates a Zellij tab layout that runs the wrapper as a `command` pane
4. The container runs opencode interactively — the TUI renders in the pane

The container gets a PTY via `docker run -it`, which opencode needs for its
TUI. The Zellij command pane provides the terminal that Docker bridges into.

## Runtime Detection

yak-box spawn auto-detects the runtime (Docker first, then Zellij):

```bash
# Force Docker mode
./bin/yak-box spawn --runtime docker --cwd . --name test --yaks test/foo "Do the thing"

# Force Zellij mode  
./bin/yak-box spawn --runtime zellij --cwd . --name test --yaks test/foo "Do the thing"
```

## Building the Worker Image

```bash
# Build from repository root (requires yx binary in tmp/)
docker build -f worker.Dockerfile -t yak-worker:latest .

# Verify
docker images yak-worker
```

The image contains: Ubuntu 24.04, git, bash, opencode CLI, yx binary.
It does NOT contain credentials — those are passed via environment variables.

## Container Architecture

### What gets mounted

| Mount | Target | Mode | Purpose |
|-------|--------|------|---------|
| Workspace root | Same path | rw | Code access (git repo) |
| .yaks directory | Same path | rw | Task state (yx) |
| Prompt file | /opt/worker/prompt.txt | ro | Worker instructions |
| Inner script | /opt/worker/start.sh | ro | Startup script |

### What is ephemeral (tmpfs)

| Mount | Size | Purpose |
|-------|------|---------|
| /tmp | 2g | Bun runtime, native binaries (needs `exec`) |
| /home/worker | 1g | Opencode state, logs, plugins |
| /home/worker/.cache | 1g | Bun/npm cache |

### Security hardening

All of these are applied and have been tested with opencode:

| Flag | Effect |
|------|--------|
| `--read-only` | Root filesystem is read-only |
| `--cap-drop ALL` | No Linux capabilities |
| `--security-opt no-new-privileges` | No privilege escalation |
| `--user $(id -u):$(id -g)` | Runs as host user (non-root) |
| `--network bridge` | Network access for LLM API |

### Critical: tmpfs needs `exec`

The `--tmpfs /tmp` mount **must** include `exec`:

```
--tmpfs /tmp:rw,exec,size=2g
```

OpenCode uses Bun, which extracts native `.node` binaries to `/tmp` and
executes them. Without `exec`, Bun fails silently and the TUI never renders.
This was the root cause of the "blank pane" bug during Docker worker development.

## Authentication

Workers receive `OPENCODE_API_KEY` as an environment variable. The key must
be set in the spawning user's environment before running yak-box spawn.

```bash
# In ~/.profile or ~/.bashrc (before the interactive guard)
export OPENCODE_API_KEY="sk-open-..."
```

yak-box spawn will refuse to start a Docker worker if the key is not set.

The container does NOT mount the host's `$HOME` or opencode auth.json.
Each container has its own isolated home directory on tmpfs.

## Testing

### E2E smoke test

```bash
./bin/yak-box spawn --runtime docker --cwd . --name test-docker \
  --yaks test/docker-yak "Say hello and report done via yx"

# Check the worker tab — TUI should render with the opencode interface
# Check task status
yx field --show test/docker-yak agent-status

# Cleanup
docker kill yak-worker-test-docker
```

### Verify security flags

```bash
docker inspect yak-worker-test-docker --format '
  CapDrop={{.HostConfig.CapDrop}}
  ReadOnly={{.HostConfig.ReadonlyRootfs}}
  SecurityOpt={{.HostConfig.SecurityOpt}}
  User={{.Config.User}}'
```

## Troubleshooting

### Blank pane — TUI doesn't render

**Cause**: `--tmpfs /tmp` without `exec` flag. Bun can't load native binaries.

**Fix**: Ensure tmpfs has `exec`: `--tmpfs /tmp:rw,exec,size=2g`

### "OPENCODE_API_KEY not set" error

**Cause**: Key not in environment. yak-box spawn checks before launching.

**Fix**: Export the key in your shell profile and source it.

### "invalid x-api-key" in opencode TUI

**Cause**: Key is truncated or incorrect.

**Fix**: Verify with `echo $OPENCODE_API_KEY | wc -c` (should be ~108 chars).

### Permission denied errors inside container

**Cause**: `--user` flag without matching tmpfs uid/gid.

**Fix**: tmpfs mounts need `uid=` and `gid=` to match the `--user` value.

### Container exits immediately

**Cause**: opencode crash, usually from missing write permissions.

**Fix**: Check `docker logs <container-name>` for the Bun/EACCES error message.
