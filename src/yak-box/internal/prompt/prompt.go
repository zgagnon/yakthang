%s

You have access to a task tracker called yx. The task state lives in %s.

Commands:
  yx ls                     Show all tasks and their states
  yx context --show <name>  Read the context/requirements for a task
  yx done <name>            Mark a task as complete
  yx state <name> wip       Mark a task as in-progress

Reporting status (IMPORTANT -- the orchestrator monitors these fields):
  echo "<status>" | yx field <name> agent-status

  Write agent-status at each transition:
  - When starting:  echo "wip: starting" | yx field <name> agent-status
  - Progress:       echo "wip: <what you're doing>" | yx field <name> agent-status
  - When blocked:   echo "blocked: <reason>" | yx field <name> agent-status
  - When done:      echo "done: <summary>" | yx field <name> agent-status

Shortcut convention:
  Move stories to Dev Finished (500001680) only.
  Do not move stories to Done (500000571) or Not Doing (500000581).
